# Elasticsearch

For: analizing data (predicting future # of calls), performing search (range, colors, price ...).
Data saved as documents.
Document's data is separated into fields (as columns in relational db).


## Elasticstack (tools for working with Elasticsearch)
- Kibana: analitics and visualization platform.
- Logstash: An event processing pipeline. Proccess logs of apps and send them to Elasticsearch.
- X-Pack: adds additional features to the Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- Graph: popular is not the same as relevant.
- Elasticsearch SQL: Query Elasticsearch with SQL.
- Beats: a collection of data shippers that send data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.

Install:
Elasticstack - https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch
Kibana - https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana


start Elasticstack: 7-zip unarchive Elasticstack -> cd Elasticstack ->  bin/elasticsearch.bat
start Kibana: 7-zip unarchive Kibana -> cd Kibana ->  bin/kibana.bat

OR running in the Cloud (trial period)

## Making Requests to Elasticstack (Cloud or Local instance)
get url (ex.: from Cloud - https://elastic-test-1.es.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:9243 )
add Basic auth


### Sharding
deviding indices into smaller pieces (if we don't have enough space)
Sharding increases the number of documents an index can store  

Primary shard - A shard that has been replicated.

### Replication
if hard drive is corrupted
Replication works by creating copies of shards, referred to as replica shards
Replica should be stored on another Node
increases availability

### SnapShots
Rollback data (can be on daily basis)


# REST:
see Postman -> Elasticsearch


### Create an Index:
PUT {{ELASTIC_HOST}}/products
- if you want to change default number of replicas or shards add the JSON object in the body
{
  "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 2,
      "number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}

### Delete an Index
DELETE {{ELASTIC_HOST}}/products
